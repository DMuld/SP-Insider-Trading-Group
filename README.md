# SP-Insider-Trading-Group-UI
Team project, to copy congresses stock trades.

This will be completed with a Bootstrap Vanilla Javascript Front-end. 

The back-end for this project will be placed in another repo, but it will be done with spring-boot Java.

This displays menus of Stock tickers and the Congress person that purchased them. It then links to where you can purchase or reasearch that information.

The number at the top right of the pop-up badges signifies the difference between the purchase date of the stocks and when it was publicly disclosed. (The lower number, the better.)
