# SP-Insider-Trading-Group-UI
Team project, to copy congresses stock trades.

This will be completed with a Bootstrap Vanilla Javascript Front-end. 

The back-end for this project will be placed in another repo, but it will be done with spring-boot Java.

This project allows for user accounts and displays the stock trades that congress members purchased. At each of these it will display the number of days since it was purchased subtracted by when it was reported. (The smaller number, the more important it would be.)

This was served on AWS Ec2 Instance. (This is no longer deployed)
